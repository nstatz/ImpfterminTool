# Content of this repository

This repo contains Scripts that might help you get an appointment
for your corona vaccination in Baden WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany.
This program got me my vaccination appointment.
It consists of 2 Parts:
1. code_bekommen
2. termin_bekommen

# Steps of code_bekommen
<b>Step 1: </b>
Change "bdate" in code_bekommen to your birthdate.

<b>Step 2:</b>
Change "location_url_dict" in code_bekommen to use the URLs of 
your vaccination centers.

<b>Step 3:</b>
Execute "code_bekommen". If you get an audio notification, you got a chance
to get your registration code. You better be fast now!
This script will have opened a chrome browser for you. Your birthday
will already have been entered.

# Steps of termin_bekommen
<b>Step 1:</b>
Get your authorization credentials for the API.
For doing this open chrome, press F12,
head to the "network" tab. Then enter the URL from your
E-Mail which you got after code_bekommen. This URL must contain
your registration code. Then check "buchung". The request header will
contain your authorization credentials to access the API.

<b>Step 2:</b>
Change or add dictionaries to the list "info_list".
Each dict must contain all the data referenced by the dictionary
keys. The list already contains example dictionaries.

<b>Step 3:</b>
Execute the script and hope you will get your appointment fast.
